					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>During my previous role at Epic, I worked as an implementation 
project manager in charge of the installation and continued success of multiple Patient Access applications for a hospital system consisting of two hospitals and 13 clinics. I also served as a training project manager in charge of planning, developing, executing, and supporting ongoing training initiatives for a high profile customer. Following that, I worked on multiple IT Security projects for American Family Insurance, preparing project plans, schedules, and timelines, processed and maintained project information in source systems, developed communication plans, coordinated cross company stakeholder meetings, and removed roadblocks from the project team. Currently, I am working as a Test Developer for Prometric where I am responsible for the lifecycle of 36 different exams. This work includes (but is not limited to) facilitating various test development related workshops with subject matter experts from various technical fields, maintaining a clean database of items, advising clients on their item bank health, creating, delivering and analyzing surveys, and conducting GAP analysis.</p>
