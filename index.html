					<h2><a id="aboutme">About Me</a></h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>My belief is that change is hard, complicated, and totally worthwhile.  During my professional career, I have been exposed to a multitude of different fields ranging from healthcare, finance, insurance, human resources, testing, and security.  This exposure, alongside my studies in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, has given me ample insights to way business works and the ways businesses struggle to effectively change for the better.</p>
<p>My biggest professional accomplishment was the successful implementation of Epic's software at a two hospital, 13 clinic health system.  The implementation taught me all about the highs, lows, long days and caffeine induced fits of laughter that one can expect when everyone in an organization switches over to a new computer system.  I am also proud of the training curriculum I developed and delivered for a government agency during my time at Epic.</p>
<p>Right now, I am enjoying my time working as a Test Developer from my home in Austin, Texas.

				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I worked as an Implementation Project Manager at Epic for 2 years.  I oversaw the Patient Access applications including Cadence, Grand Central, Prelude, Referrals, and Welcome.  These applications aid hospital workers with scheduling appointments, admissions, transfers, discharges, patient registrations, referrals, and kiosks.</p>
					<p>I wore multiple hats in this role.  Although my position title was Implementation Project Manager, I acted as a project manager, trainer, and technical analyst.  As a project manager, I helped create the roadmap that the application analysts worked off for the duration of the project, ensured tasks were completed on time, and analyzed key metrics related to my applications to identify what departments were struggling before, during, and after the go-live.  As a trainer, I developed a custom curriculum for a customer, created the training environment for trainees to utilize, and trained the end users on how to use the software.  This required me to learn the end user's legacy workflows and figure out how they would change using the new technology.  Lastly as a technical analyst, I was required to configure Epic's software and advise analysts on how the software could best suit their needs.</p>

				<div class="content">
					<p>I worked as a contracted project coordinator for American Family Insurance for a year following my time at Epic.  I was immediately placed on a wide variety of IT projects and had to quickly learn to navigate the rigid organizational structure set in place to get my work done.  Notable projects that I worked on included the implementation of new identity governance and admin software, the consolidation and restructuring of the privileged account management process, and the stand up of an insider threat committee.  During this time, I received experience related to project budgets, resource allocation, and formal project tracking and documentation that I did not find at Epic.  I experienced a vastly different organizational structure and learned how culture can play a large role in the successful and timely completion of internal projects.</p>

				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I worked at Prometric for a year after I graduated with my Masters from Radford University.  I thoroughly enjoyed being a test developer, but I decided to leave to be closer to my family.  I was fortunate to leave on good enough terms that Prometric reached out to me 3 years later to inquire about coming back to work remotely, which is where I currently find myself employed.  As a test developer, I am responsible for the lifecycle of my client's exams.  This entails conducting job analyses, GAP analysis, facilitating workshops with subject matter experts from a variety of fields, developing surveys and analyzing results, maintaining multiple databases full of test questions, developing project schedules, and maintaining positive client relationships.</p>
					<p>I have learned a variety of skills as a Test Developer.  As with my previous jobs, I am required to use various programs such as Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, Wrike, Surpass, Verint, Qualtrics, and SharePoint on a day to day basis.  However, in my current role I facilitate a lot of different workshops which requires me to think on my feet, quickly decipher information from subject matter experts and extract pertinent content, and keep the group on track so that my goals are accomplished.
