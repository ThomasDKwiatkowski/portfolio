					<p>Insert about information here.
						    Girl gets food (1), gets to her room and falls asleep (2), gets incredibly sick and has nightmares, she sleepwalks into the elevator to help the doctor living below her (3, 4), and she gets caught in the elevator and dies there (5).
The tourist gets to the embassy which loses power, he decides to get out before he’s trapped there (1, 2).  He climbs out the embassy window at night, steals a bike, robs an REI (electric bike), runs from the cops and escapes on a bike trail (3, 4).
The doctor is under a lot of stress, goes to work (1), works (2, 3), gets home and ignores the girls pounding, insisting that he is hallucinating (4)


The sky was dark gray as always, but today it promised rain as well.  How generous thought Wei, the puddles on the sidewalk haven’t even dried up yet.  The concrete sure could use the water, it’s been looking a little gray lately.  She pulled her coat a little closer, trying to stay warm.  Lately she’s either been too hot, even with the window open, or she can’t warm up no matter how many blankets she covered herself with.

This was a large city.  One of the great things about a large city is that everything is nearby, so you don’t have to actually go anywhere.  You could easily hide from the city within the city itself, just don’t try getting out without a plan.  No plan was necessary for Wei today though.  She was just going to grab some groceries and fight off this fever.  She adjusted her mask as the automatic doors slid open.  In and out. That’s the plan.

That was everyone’s plan.  Nobody wanted to spend more time in public than was absolutely necessary these days.  It wasn’t a big deal, but the news had been headlining some virus every day for the past month.  It was spreading, but Wei didn’t know anyone who had caught it yet and the number of cases was still a pretty low percentage of the population as a whole.  Chances were she didn’t have it.  She hadn’t even coughed once, and the novel virus was a respiratory problem.  Chances were she wouldn’t get it.  Regardless, she didn’t want to spend more time in public than she had to.

Wei could only buy what she could carry home, but that included eggs, cheese, oatmeal, shrimp, pasta, frozen veggies, and some sauces.  There weren’t any disinfectant wipes left which was unfortunate, but she was sure they’d be there next time.

“Your total is 32.32 today” the cashier told her in a droll voice.  “Ha, look at that.  A palindrome.”
“No it’s not” Wei said softly.
“Yeah, it’s 32.32.  Oh you had a coupon.  31.82.”
Wei was about to say that wasn’t what she meant, but the thought of explaining what a palindrome was to a cashier felt exhausting.  She coughed instead.
“Yikes, stay healthy.  You don’t wanna catch the virus” the clerk said, pointing towards the magazines.
“Thanks,” Wei said, pulling out her phone to pay.  But her phone was deader than the 250-some-odd infected folks on that cruise ship outside of Japan.  She rummaged through her purse and pulled out a credit card instead.

Outside again, Wei put her head down and started home.  It was raining, just like the skies promised.  Good thing she forgot about the environment and used plastic bags instead of a paper one.  How disappointed Mother Earth must be in her.  The puddles looked like they were dancing from the rain; happy to show off the neon lights they looked up to.  Her bed was going to feel so good later.  As she rounded the street corner, she almost decided to take the long way home to make herself feel a little bit more miserable so that her bed felt a little bit more comfortable.  Instead, she ran right into a man who was busy staring at his phone.

“Uh sorry” he murmured as Wei’s hand slipped and dropped her bag.  He awkwardly made a dramatically long step over her groceries as if he had to make up time for this brief interruption.  He picked up the package of shrimp, tossed it to Wei and kept walking.  Wei had bent down to pick up the bag.  Not expecting her groceries to be thrown at her, the package of shrimp hit her smack in the face and fell to the concrete a second time.  Wei blinked and shook her head.  Wrong move.  That gave her a headache and left her slightly disoriented.  At least now she was miserable enough to skip the detour and go straight to bed, after she fried up the sidewalk shrimp of course.
“I got another bonus.  It’s crazy, but this disease or whatever has been going on is great for business.”
A virus, Dong though irritably, it’s a freaking virus.  Your company makes the goddamn ventilators that seem to help the patients breathe.  You sell the goddamn machines.  How don’t you know it’s a virus?
“It’s not so great for the 1,000 people who have died from it in New York so far, or for the 16,000 who died in Italy.”
“True, but I’m helping them.  I think the vice wants to see what I’ve been working on.  It’s getting me more time with the higher ups which is awesome.  Hey I gotta run! Later bro.”
“Bye,” Dong said.  It’s amazing how he could be on the phone for over 30 minutes with someone close who never asked a single question about how he was doing.  He was acting as a diplomat in a foreign country for christ's sake.  Must not be that important though.  Dong rolled his eyes as his phone vibrated again, this time from his boss.
“Hey, what’s up?”
“Dong you have to get to the embassy now.  Have you read the news about the 35 bodies in the nursing home near the river?  Word is there’s going to be a major lockdown, and without much public notice.  Some German scientist discovered that the virus is mutating or something and shit’s about to get way worse.  We’re going home tonight.  Listen, I have to call Seo Young too, how long until you can get here?”
“Holy shit I’m on my way now, near 5th and Dachak-ro.  20 minutes probably.”
“Good.  See you soon.”
Dong hung up and immediately started scanning the news for the nursing home tragedy.  35 bodies?  They couldn't have all died at once.  Was there a morgue in the basement or something?  It didn’t take Dong more than a few seconds to find the headline.
	Police found 35 bodies stored in a morgue built to house 6 connected to Hidden Oaks nursing home after receiving an anonymous tip that a body was being stored in a shed.  While there is no indication of foul play, it appears that nursing homes everywhere are simply being overrun by the virus.  At this point, it is still unclear just how many people have died from the novel virus, but it is clear that it is dangerous to the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.  What’s unclear is how this particular virus is transferred from one to another because hotspots appear in seemingly random areas.  Experts hypothesize that either there is a long incubation period before a patient starts to show symptoms, or some infected are completely asymptomatic.  Everyone is encouraged to wash…

Dong had read enough.  Practice hygiene; not that hard.  It makes sense that the country was heading toward a lockdown.  If the virus had a lengthy incubation period before showing symptoms, or if people were asymptomatic, anyone walking down the street could have it and give it to Dong.  Hell, he could be giving it to others without knowing it.  Better to lock down, but preferably when Dong was out of the country and back home.  Dong started to walk faster and scanned the news for any hint of a lockdown when WHAM!  He ran right into a woman.
“Uhh, sorry” he murmured as her groceries went everywhere.  Dong bent over to pick up the shrimp bag closest to him.  He was about to hand it to her when he remembered that she might have the virus.  The thought made him panic and he ended up throwing the shrimp at her.  Ashamed at his own reaction, Dong quickly got up and continued to the embassy.
The whirring of the white noise maker stopped at 8 am, just as planned.  The inevitable noise of the city rushed into Quien's tiny apartment, waking and annoying him as no typical alarm clock could.  Even here, 13 stories above the hustle and bustle of the city, the ceaseless sounds of highway 151 could be heard clearly.  Quien had always been a light sleeper, which meant he never got enough sleep.  Every time he told one of his patients to try to get more sleep, he laughed inwardly at his own hypocrisy.  Sure, sleep improves mental well being and Quien had tried all the methods he recommends to improve his own, but for all that trouble his body simply refused to recover every night.  That was until he went on a rather successful date with a tall, athletic woman and spent the night at her apartment.  The sex was great, but what really topped off the night was when she rolled over and turned on her EZ-Sleep 3000 white noise maker.  Quien slept like a baby that night and immediately ordered the same emodel for himself the next morning.  It even had an alarm feature!

He threw off his covers and went to the bathroom to empty his bowels.  He pushed and pushed, running out of breath in the unsuccessful process.  Afterward, he put the kettle on the stove to make some tea.  A second later, a hiss could be heard coming from the kitchen.  The hiss could easily have been mistaken for a high pitch scream, but definitely not a tea kettle boiling.  Pipes pumping hot water to the rest of the building ran right through Quein’s apartment which led to a frequent hiss and an occasional banging sound.  The landlord said it was just water hitting a valve when someone above or below him turned their water on and off, but Quein wasn’t convinced because of the consistency in which he heard the baning.

Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang… Bang… Bang…

And over and over and over again.  Maybe someone with OCD lived above him and had to turn the water on and off in patterns of 3 to keep their internal monsters at bay..  If so, Quien didn’t really mind.  He was a very patient man who worked long hours as a psychiatrist doing “good” in the world.  Plus, the cheap rent helped him pay off his crippling student debt just a little faster. The landlord even offered him a small discount because he was living on the 13th floor and the world was full of superstitious folk; however, Quein did not fall into that category.

The kettle began to hiss over the scream of the pipe, no small feat.  Quien poured some on top of a tea bag that lay at the bottom of his reusable to-go mug which read “Go Earth!”.  He grabbed his lap top, medical ID badge, phone, wallet, and keys, put on his face mask, locked up, and waited for the elevator.

The metal walls of the elevator was Quien’s only mirror.  He adjusted his tie and thanked the god he didn’t believe in that nobody was waiting for him when the doors opened.  Considering the time it took the elevator doors to close, go down a floor, and open again, Quien estimated that he had at least 30 more seconds of solitude on the slow ride down.

Nobody else was riding the lift this morning.  Quein stared at the numbers as they lit up.

The elevator lurched.  The lights went out.  Nothing moved for a full 5 seconds.  Oh shit, Quien thought.  How am I going to explain this to Perry?  Perry was a habitual liar who saw every inconvenience as a personal slight. Then, as suddenly as everything stopped, everything started again.

Ding.  The doors opened and Quien got out just as a girl carrying groceries entered the elevator.

Quien stepped outside into the rain and headed for the hospital.  It’s going to be a wet 15 minute commute to work, he thought.  He put in his headphones to listen to his case notes from his last session with his first patient.
	Perry spent ample time discussing his brother’s work at the embassy.  While he continues to deny that he is intimidated by his brother, he repeatedly compares his own accomplishes to those of his brother.

HOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooo

An alarm wailed over the entire city as if enemy bombers were in sight.  Quien wasn’t expecting this, there hadn’t been anything on the news about international tensions or an escalating war, the weather looked perfectly clear, and nobody set off alarms for earthquakes.  Maybe a tsunami is on it’s way?  If so, Quien would be pulled from his sessions to help with the chaos.  During disasters, all medical staff are expected to help.  Two jets flew low over the city.  Police sirens rose from seemingly every direction.  A black van stopped at the crosswalk in front of Quien.  Two men got out and began unloading what appeared to be a black trash can.  One of the men took out a tablet, focusing intently and selecting a few options.  The trash can rolled to the street corner and projected a loud siren.  After the siren was silenced, a recording said:

	THIS IS A CITY WIDE LOCKDOWN.  ALL CITIZENS MUST MAKE THEIR WAY HOME IMMEDIATELY.  THIS IS NOT A DRILL.  ALL CITIZENS MUST MAKE THEIR WAY HOME IMMEDIATELY.  DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DWELLINGS UNLESS IT IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.  ANY CITIZENS FOUND OUTSIDE Of THEIR HOME WILL BE PROSECUTED.

The two men, seemingly satisfied, closed up the van and drove off, but not before Quien noticed that the trunk was full of more trash cans.

Dong approached the embassy as a black van stopped across the street.  Two men wearing masks got out and started to unload a large square robotic trash can.  Immediately the robot started adding an alarm to the symphony of alarms that penetrated the city.  Dong closed his ears with his fingers and stepped inside.

The scene that awaited Dong was utter chaos.  The room was packed with people.  Armed guards attempted to stop the crowd from pushing and shoving.  Dong quickly noticed that hardly anyone was wearing a facemask.  He moved to a discrete corner behind an open door to try and get some space.  This was madness, a health risk, chaos.  He got out his phone and quickly searched the headlines.  Sure enough, this country was going on full lockdown mode.  Nobody was going to get in or out.  The embassy might be his safest place to get home, but it would take a long time.  Time that he’d spend waiting in a large group of strangers.  Time he would spend likely contracting the virus.  Then where was he supposed to go when he got sick?  A foreign hospital?  They couldn’t hold him there for the full length of his sickness unless he was close to death.  If he was admitted at all he’d be tagged before he got discharged, and in doing so he’d effectively eliminate any chance of travelling out of the country.  He couldn’t afford to stay here for weeks.  He had to get out of this city, then he’d figure out how the hell he was going to fly home.  Get out of the city to reduce the chances of getting sick. If you’re not sick, you can get home.

That’s when the lights of the embassy went out.  A couple of teenage girls who looked like they were on a trip together screamed together.  One of them made direct eye contact with Dong, held his gaze for a full 3 seconds, and then screamed a high pitch banshee scream.  A bell started ringing from the elevator, someone was stuck in there.  It’s always better to take the stairs Dong thought numbly.

“Everyone stay calm! We have a backup generator that will kick in momentarily” a lady in a navy suit shouted from behind a counter.  Sure enough, the generator kicked in and the momentary loss of power passed into memory.  The screams from the girls didn’t help, Dong was feeling very jittery.  He couldn’t stay here, he had to get out.  The elevator next to him dinged and the door began to open.  Three scared looking women got out hastily followed by a stale stench of urine.  The folks nearest the elevator looked at each other and decided not to get in; things weren’t that chaotic yet.  The door Dong was standing behind started to creep into his corner a little further as a group of adults clambered into the embassy.  The hall was full and filling up fast.  To hell with it; Dong got into the elevator and kicked the 3rd floor button with his foot.

When the elevator opened moments later, Dong got out quickly not because he was scared of being stuck in the elevator, that had happened to him a few years ago and it was more boring than anything, but because one or all of the women in the lift before him clearly ate some asparagus “spurgies” the night before.  This floor was eerily quiet.  Dong wondered if he needed some sort of authorization to be here… but with the chaos downstairs he was sure he’d gone up unnoticed.  There was a window overlooking the plaza to the right.  Dong heard the alarms from the robots outside and saw the streets were very empty except for police vehicles.
He started walking down the hall, peering into the various offices as he came across them.  Nobody was home.  Dong circled the entire floor and didn’t find a single person, so he went up to the fourth floor, this time taking the stairwell instead of the urinal.  Here the halls did not have any lights on.  This must not be deemed an essential floor during a crisis.  He turned to head back into the stairwell when he heard footsteps coming down the stairwell.

“We have to get out now, but I don't know how the hell we’re going to.  The government has already told us they’re going to imprison anyone they find outside, no matter where they came from or what sort of diplomatic immunity they have.  The Germans just found out the virus is mutating fast and it’s spreading at an exponential rate.  Do you have a place to stay?  I have a condo down the street.”

“Yes, my aunt lives outside the city.  She’s already agreed to let me stay there.”

“I don’t think you’ll make it.  They’re going to start imprisoning people within the hour.  Can you imagine if you’re imprisoned with a virus on the loose?  It’ll cut through jails like a wildfire through dry brush.  Come stay with me for now, and then we’ll get this thing figured out.”

Dong heard the sound of the stairwell door closing.  So people were really going to be imprisoned for being outside?  What about all the people on the first floor of the embassy?  Where were they supposed to go?  Surely they couldn’t all hang out in the embassy forever.  Dong headed up the stairs.  At the top of the stairwell there was a ladder leading up to a locked hatch that read “Roof Access: Authorized Personnel Only”.  Dong scurried up the ladder and tried the padlock.  No luck.  He scampered back down and opened the door to the top floor of the building.  The air was clean here, and there was ample natural light.  This executive floor was definitely meant to impress visitors.  Dong let out a low whistle and started looking around.  Whoever habited the first office looked like a baseball fan.  Dong pocketed the tenant’s 6 inch mini bat after briefly admiring the polished Go Brewers logo.  On his way out he grabbed the metal door wedge keeping the air fresh inside the office.  Dong headed back to the ladder, stuck the door wedge and the mini bat into the padlock and wrapped one of his arms through the ladder to keep his balance.  He started to pull the bat and the wedge apart, breaking the lock without much effort.  Cheap piece of shit must have been more for looks than anything else.  Dong opened the hatch and climbed onto the roof.
Wei nodded to the doctor as he was leaving the elevator.  She hadn’t ever talked to him, but his mailbox said “Dr. Q” on the front and he was always wearing his work badge where it was nice and visible.  What a dork.  I wonder what kind of doctor he is, thought Wei, maybe he could prescribe me some pills to keep my fever down.  Dr. Q was out of earshot before Wei could muster up the courage to break their unspoken pact to nod without speaking whenever they crossed paths.  It was a long standing pact, both of them agreeing to it when they crossed paths for the first time.  Neither had failed to break the pact in any way either.  In some ways, Dr. Q and Wei were close to each other in that they consistently acknowledged the presence of one another.  Wei appreciated that, and thought she might make him cookies some time.  No, that would violate the distance of the pact.  Nodding was a low effort gesture; she could always nod.  If she were to start saying hello, which took a lot more energy, Dr. Q would become accustomed to receiving a verbal greeting.  Then if the day came, like today, when she wasn’t feeling well or didn’t have the energy to verbalise a hello, Dr. Q would take that as a slight.  From that point on Wei would have to either make up for her transgression which would take an exponential amount of effort, or else things would become awkward and devolve at an exponential rate.  No, it was better to keep a neutral nod.

Wei lived on the 14th floor.  Normally, she took the stairs because it helped her reach her step goal, and the elevator was unbelievably slow.  If the elevator made a stop on any floor below hers to let another passenger off she immediately regretted taking it because the stairs would be faster.  It wasn’t just the slow rise of the elevator, but when it stopped there was a 5 second pause before the doors would open, as if the elevator had to take a deep breath from climbing the building before it had the strength to open its doors.  Today the stairs weren’t an option though.  Wei was feeling way worse than she had at the grocery store.  The walk through the rain left her out of breath and achy.

Out of habit, she took out her phone to see what her friends were up to, but her phone was dead.  How could she have forgotten.  She pressed the 14th button and it lit up.  Even that was feeling overly bright now.  The elevator started it’s slow ascent to the top floor.  Wei used the metal door to check her reflection and what she saw was staggering.  Her long hair had gone bleach white.  Her skin was covered in boils and acne.  Her teeth were yellow and her eyes, the whites of her eyes were now red.  Her skin was waxy and pale.  The lights suddenly went out.  Wei started to freak out.  She dropped her shrimp and reached out to touch the spot where her reflection was.  The lights came back on and Wei saw her reflection was back to normal; a brown haired, almond eyed girl with perfect teeth and a fresh tan.  Perfectly healthy, only sick at the moment.

When she reached her floor Wei threw all of the groceries directly in the freezer.  She poured herself a glass of water from the tap and barely made it to her bed before falling asleep.
Quien was transferred from the psych ward to primary care for the day.  Or maybe the week.  Or until he caught the virus everyone was pulled in to help treat.  This side of the hospital was overrun with patients coughing, sneezing, sweating, groaning, and wheezing.  Quien approached the front desk to see who he was going to help next.

“Mrs. Lacting has been waiting here for 26 straight hours.  Her conditions aren’t as bad as some of the other patients coming in which is why our system keeps lowering her on the priority list, but I’m afraid if she sits in this waiting room any further she’s going to sue our asses.”

“Perfect.” Quien said.  “Which one is she?”

The schegistrar pointed Quien to a lone middle aged woman leaning her head against a wall in the far corner.  Quien approached her slowly and softly said “Mrs. Lacting? I can see you now.”

Mrs. Lacting started when she heard Dr. Q.  “Are you serious?” She got up and followed Dr. Q.  “I’ve been trying to sleep for the past 12 hours but I’m a very light sleeper.  I was almost asleep when you got me.  Not that I’m complaining.  I can sleep when I’m home, I can... sleep when I’m home.”

“When was the last time you slept?  I can prescribe you some medication that will help you doze off if you’ve been experiencing frequent insomnia.”

“No, I sleep fine at home when the shades are drawn and the lights are off.  I like the dark.  I’m here because… I… sorry… I haven’t slept…” she said in between yawns.

“You’re here because you haven’t slept?”

“No, I have been running a fever.  The devil’s come to visit me a few times.  He says I’ll go to sleep soon, so I’ve been trying to stay awake.”

“The devil?”

“Figure of speech.  I know I didn’t really see him.  I’m just so tired and the waiting room is full of sickness.  It’s the devils way of telling me he’s nearby.  He’s in this place.  He’s elusive, so not many others have noticed that he’s here, but if he gets too close to some… well, it’s hard to ignore the reaper when he’s knocking on your door.”

“Mrs. Lacting, I think you need some sleep.  Have you taken anything to reduce your fever?”

“That man who came through the waiting room on a stretcher couldn’t breathe.  I saw it in his eyes when he looked at me.  That’s when I knew the devil was here.”  She was starting to get a little frantic.  “The reaper's surrounding this country.  I would have gone home in the night, but they’re arresting people who are out of their homes and I couldn’t get a doctor’s note until I was seen by you.  The devil trapped me here.”

Quien finished taking Mrs. Lacting’s temperature which was a staggering 105.  How was this lady’s symptoms a low priority?  Clearly her fever and lack of sleep was making her delusional, though some of what she said eerily resonated with Quien.  This was the 4th patient Quien had seen so far today who was talking about the devil or the reaper being nearby.  All of them were just experiencing a fever without any other symptoms of the virus, but QUein suspected they had it nonetheless even though he couldn’t confirm it with a test.  Their lab was already over capacity to test the swabs that doctors had been taking all night, so the administrative staff told the doctors to save time and not bother testing.  Chances were every patient they saw today had the virus; better to treat their symptoms and help wherever they could.  Mrs. Lacting just needed some sleep and some meds to reduce her fever.  THe fever might be helping though, it’s the body’s natural reaction to fight off viruses.

Quein sent her home with a signed pass.  The hospital received a visit from the chief of police a few hours ago that they would be arresting anyone who was breaking the lockdown rules.  Exceptions were only made for folks who were seeking medical care or returning from receiving care.  In both cases, the hospital had to issue them a pass, via fax, email, or in person, that must be displayed at all times while they were out.  When a person was stopped, the police would call in the patient to verify that the pass was genuine.  The hospital began receiving so many verification calls that they had to devote half of their triagers in the call centers to verify patients could be traveling to/from their home and the hospital.  One look at the triager’s and you’d see right away that they were overwhelmed with calls, and terrified that if they made any mistakes during their shift that it could mean the wrongful imprisonment of some poor sick patient.  That patient would then likely infect the rest of the jail, which the police chief quickly pointed out was over capacity already.  Even though it was hard now, they had to be strict and keep folks in their homes or else the entire hospital system in the whole country would be overrun within days.

Quien adjusted his mask and headed back to the front desk.  “Who’s next?” he asked the schegistrar.
Wei woke up.  Why was it dark?  She tried to open her eyes.  She couldn’t open her eyes.  Someone was knocking on her door.  She tried to get up, but she couldn’t move.  The knocking grew more persistent.  She tried to call out, but she couldn’t draw a breath.  She was suffocating.  She tried to open her eyes again. With a huge amount of effort she was able to pry them slowly open.

Two red eyes were staring at her, inches from her face.  The creature’s breath reeked with the stench of fish and decay.  It’s black skin was covered in red cuts weeping a seemingly endless pool of fresh blood.  Wei could feel the blood rising around her body.  She tried to scream but her mouth was useless.  The creature laughed and jumped off her chest.  She could breathe again and inhaled deeply.  She coughed up blood that wasn’t her own and drew another breath as the blood around her rose above her ears.  This must be the reaper she thought.

“Yes I am” a voice rattled.

Wei woke up with a start and looked around breathing hard.  Her palms were sweaty and her sheets were drenched, but everything looked normal enough.  It was just a dream, albeit a vivid one.  She felt her forehead and could tell she was running a very high fever.  She should go to the doctor’s office.  She grabbed the glass of water next to her bed and took a sip.  She coughed and threw back her covers.  That was a terrible fever dream.  Wei had never had one before, and the experience left her shaking.  She stumbled to the bathroom and rummaged around her medicine cabinet, popped a few ibuprofen, and went back to bed.  She should probably go to the doctor, but she was feeling so tired and getting up to find the medicine caused her body to start shaking uncontrollably.  How could she have been hot just a second before?  She was freezing cold now.  She pulled the blankets over her head and tucked herself into a fetal position, waiting for the shaking to stop as sleep took her once again.
