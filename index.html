Girl gets food (1), gets to her room and falls asleep (2), gets incredibly sick and has nightmares, she sleepwalks into the elevator to help the doctor living below her (3, 4), and she gets caught in the elevator and dies there (5). The tourist gets to the embassy which loses power, he decides to get out before he’s trapped there (1, 2).  He climbs out the embassy window at night, steals a bike, robs an REI (electric bike), runs from the cops and escapes on a bike trail (3, 4). The doctor is under a lot of stress, goes to work (1), works (2, 3), gets home and ignores the girls pounding, insisting that he is hallucinating (4)</p>
