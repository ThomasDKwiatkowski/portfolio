<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
<p>During my previous role at Epic, I worked as an implementation project manager in charge of
the installation and continued success of multiple Patient Access applications for a hospital
system consisting of two hospitals and 13 clinics. I also served as a training project manager in
charge of planning, developing, executing, and supporting ongoing training initiatives for a high
profile customer. Following that, I worked on multiple IT Security projects for American Family
Insurance, preparing project plans, schedules, and timelines, processed and maintained project
information in source systems, developed communication plans, coordinated cross company
stakeholder meetings, and removed roadblocks from the project team. Currently, I am working
as a Test Developer for Prometric where I am responsible for the lifecycle of 36 different exams.
This work includes (but is not limited to) facilitating various test development related workshops
with subject matter experts from various technical fields, maintaining a clean database of items,
advising clients on their item bank health, creating, delivering and analyzing surveys, and
conducting GAP analysis.</p>
